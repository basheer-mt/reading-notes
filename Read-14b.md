Google, one of the most outspoken proponents of how learning jobs would boost productivity, became obsessed with assembling the ideal team back in 2011. The tech beast has spent tens of millions of dollars tracking virtually every part of its workers' lives over the last decade. Google's People Operations team has looked at everything from how many different people eat together (the most efficient workers prefer to create wider networks by rotating dining companions) to which characteristics the best managers have in common (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).
