# Growth-Mindset

## Grwoth Mindset for me is the ability to adapt to any changes and obstacles that I may experience.

This pandamic for instance is one big oppurtunity for those who thing big and difference! 

I started my learning journey of coding last year during the lockdown, but I started it alone with bunch of online courses on **Udemy** and other websites. But I needed the guideness and someone to show me the right path and track and help me along the way when needed.

I know many of people who lost their mind not only their jobs to the pandamic, and they didn't do anything but waiting this to be over in a hope they will be back to their jobs. Well, that's not what I did.


I kept and will always keep reminding myself of how to maintain this growth mindest unitl it become a part of my personality. I will mention some of the positive tricks that I'm using as reminders:

### 1.  I Value the process over the end result.
As Greg Anderson once said:
> Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it. 

### 2. I View challenges as opportunities.
Another quote by Ralph Marston:
> If you so choose, challenges can make you stronger. If you so choose, the disappointments can make you more determined.

### 3. I Use the word **"yet"**
Last but not least, Carol Dweck once said:

> Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going.

I used to say "I don't get it" "I can't do this" "This isn't working" but each time I face one of these situations I started to stop myself and say:
 Take a deep breath, Go for a walk, then come back and add this simple 3 letter word to your sentences:

 > I don't get it YET

 > I can't do it this YET

 > This isn't working YET

 ### well, that has been said, let me introduce myself properly.
 My name is Mohammad Basheer, also known as Mohammad Alkiswani.
 I left behind a journey of 14 years in the FMCG and the industrial world to pursue another target in the coding world.
