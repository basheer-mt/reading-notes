# Text Editors

### Choosing a text editor

Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice because for the most parts, they're all pretty similar.

I think the best text editor is truely the one you enjoy using the most.

## What is a Text Editor?

It's a software that you download and install on your computer, or access online that allows you to write and manage text, especially codes (text you write to build a website).


## Features you should look for in a text editor:

1) Code completion: allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
2) Syntax Highlighting: Colorizing text, make it easier to read.
3) Themes: Background and text color, easier to read and find mistakes, reduce eye strain and fatigue.
4) Extentions: Like blugins that give you superpowers while you grow.

## Your Options:
#### 1) Software that already comes with your computer

                  a) MacOS:   "Text Edit"
                  b) Windows: "NotePad"
                  c) Linux:   "Gedit"
                  
The above three options usually don't have many feature to speak of, but if you want to try using them anyway, you need to know the following:

- No Bold text, no underline, no italic, Plain text only! which is basically the code text.
- Make sure to save all documents of the website in one main folder, and pay close attention to the file extention: .HTML .CSS
- No special bells or whistles, no code completion; these text editors won't assesst you find your mistakes.
- No Syntax highlighting, no themes, and no extentions.

All that beed said, you still can use them to build a website, but the question is, Should you??
